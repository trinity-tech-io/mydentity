      title: "What is a DID?",
      content: <p>A DID is a digital identifier for yourself, a bit like your Google account is. But it's actually rather different than your Google or Apple account, because it is what fashion people call <b>decentralized</b>.
        <br /><br />
        <i>What does that really mean, decentralized?</i><br /><br />
        This means that the identifier is not controlled by a company, it's controlled by yourself only. Basically, with this identity, you sign information that you share with apps, and no one else than you can reproduce this signature. As a result, anyone can make sure where a piece of information comes from.</p>
